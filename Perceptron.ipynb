    "Write a couple paragraphs interpreting the results with all the combinations of hyperparameters. Drawing a plot will probably help you make a point. In particular, answer the following:\n",
    "- A. Do you need to train with all the training dataset to get the highest accuracy with the test dataset?\n",
    "- B. How do you justify that training the second run obtains worse accuracy than the first one (despite the second one uses more training data)?\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "#tr: 100, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.050; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 71.0\n",
    "#tr: 200, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.005; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 68.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "- C. Can you get higher accuracy with additional hyperparameters (higher than `80.0`)?\n",
    "- D. Is it always worth training for more epochs (while keeping all other hyperparameters fixed)?\n",
